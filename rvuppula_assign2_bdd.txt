User story:
As a cryptographer, I need to check whether my test cases for encryption and decryption functions are working fine or not
BDD:
Scenario: cryptographer wants to encrypt and decrypt given string
Given [encrypt and decrypt functions] 
When [user inputs a [encrypt|decrypt] string and key for ceaser cipher in command line arguments] 
Then [the output should contain the encrypted or decrypted string]
